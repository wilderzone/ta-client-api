# TA Client API

Control TA programmatically with JavaScript.

```sh
npm install ta-client-api
```

## Usage

```js
import { GameClient } from 'ta-client-api';

// The path to your TA executable (can be relative or absolute).
const path = 'C:/path/to/TribesAscend.exe';

// Create a new game client instance.
const client = new GameClient(path);
```

### Configuration

The easiest way to configure the client is through the chainable settings methods.
Each method is optional and can be used in any order. For example, to launch the game in a 700px тип 450px window: 

```js
client
	.windowed(true)           // Enable windowed mode.
	.resolution(700, 450)     // Set the resolution.
	.start();                 // Launch the game.
```

### Events

You can register callback functions to listen for certain events emitted by the game client.  
For example, to log a message when the client starts:
```js
client.on('start', () => {
	console.log('Woohoo!');
});
```

| Event   | Description                                                                     |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `start` | Emitted when the game client has started up and is ready to be interacted with. |
| `stop`  | Emitted when the game client has stopped running (either intentionally, or from a crash) and is no longer accessible. |
